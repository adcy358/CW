# CW - TASK 1 

In this task, we needed to develop a simple game consisting of a rectangular grid (of size height x width) where each cell has a random value between 0 and 9. An agent starts at the upper-left corner of the grid and must reach the lower-right corner of the grid as fast as possible. The task consisted of finding the shortest path. 

# Description

The task is divided in the following parts: 

- Implementation of the game. 
- Develop your own heuristic algorithm.
- Implement the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points. 
- Plan and implement a statistical analysis of the results.

# Getting started 

## Dependencies

Used packages: 
- sys
- Numpy 

# Acknowledgments
The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm would not have been possible without the aid of the following:
- the lectures which gave me the ground knowledge
- the Udacity article by Alexey Klochay that served as a much-needed guideline.
